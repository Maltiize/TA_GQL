# TheFork backend test
## Notes to the fork

To complete the project, I added a redis instance, and a little gihub workflow to run my tests.


One other possible improvements would be to also create an image after each commit and send it to a repository manager


Maybe also handling the conf of the system with a .env file instead of having it inside the repo within a hard coded file.


anyway, have a good read and a nice day :)
